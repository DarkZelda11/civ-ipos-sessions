'''different ways to reuse the same code
as a module'''

import greeter
greeter.greet()

# use an alias - consider why might we do this?
# import greeter as g
# g.greet()

# sometimes we only want to import what we need
# from greeter import greet
# greet()

# Additional Activity create a calculator class in the module
# import greeter
calculator = greeter.Calculator(2,3)
result = calculator.calculate()
# Use the new class to return a score to a user


print(f"Result of addition: {result}")
